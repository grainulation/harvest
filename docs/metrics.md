# Harvest Metrics Reference

Harvest tracks quantitative metrics across your wheat sprints. Every metric is computed from `compilation.json` and stored as a JSON object with a consistent schema.

## Claim Counts by Type

Total claims broken down by type. Use this to spot sprints that are recommendation-heavy but evidence-light.

```json
{
  "metric": "claim_counts_by_type",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-16T12:00:00Z",
  "data": { "constraint": 12, "factual": 45, "estimate": 8, "risk": 19, "recommendation": 14, "feedback": 6 }
}
```

## Evidence Tier Distribution

Counts claims at each evidence tier. A healthy sprint trends toward `documented` and `tested` over time.

```json
{
  "metric": "evidence_tier_distribution",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-16T12:00:00Z",
  "data": { "stated": 5, "web": 18, "documented": 32, "tested": 14, "production": 3 }
}
```

## Topic Coverage

Measures how many distinct topics have claims and the depth per topic. Topics with only one claim type are flagged as monocultures.

```json
{
  "metric": "topic_coverage",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-16T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "total_topics": 9,
    "topics": [
      { "name": "connection-pooling", "claim_count": 12, "types": ["factual", "risk", "recommendation"], "monoculture": false },
      { "name": "auth-sessions", "claim_count": 3, "types": ["factual"], "monoculture": true }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Prediction Accuracy (Brier Scores)

After `/calibrate`, harvest computes Brier scores for estimate claims. Lower is better. A score of 0 means perfect prediction; 1 means maximally wrong.

```json
{
  "metric": "prediction_accuracy",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-16T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "mean_brier_score": 0.18,
    "scores": [
      { "claim_id": "e003", "predicted": "2-4 weeks", "actual": "6 weeks", "brier": 0.42 },
      { "claim_id": "e007", "predicted": "sub-100ms p99", "actual": "87ms p99", "brier": 0.02 }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Knowledge Decay Rate

Tracks how quickly claims become stale. Measures the time between a claim's creation and its first challenge or supersession.

```json
{
  "metric": "knowledge_decay_rate",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-16T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "median_days_to_challenge": 14,
    "median_days_to_supersede": 31,
    "claims_never_challenged_pct": 0.62
  }
}
```

## Sprint Velocity

Claims added, resolved, and retracted per unit of time. Computed per day and per phase.

```json
{
  "metric": "sprint_velocity",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-16T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "claims_per_day": 8.3,
    "by_phase": { "define": { "claims": 12, "days": 1 }, "research": { "claims": 48, "days": 5 }, "prototype": { "claims": 18, "days": 3 }, "evaluate": { "claims": 10, "days": 2 } }
  }
}
```

## Conflict Resolution Rate

Tracks how quickly conflicts are detected and resolved. Unresolved conflicts block compilation.

```json
{
  "metric": "conflict_resolution_rate",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-16T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "total_conflicts": 7,
    "resolved": 5,
    "unresolved": 2,
    "median_hours_to_resolve": 4.2
  }
}
```

## Common Fields

Every metric object includes:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `metric` | string | Machine-readable metric name |
| `timestamp` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp of computation |
| `data` | object | Metric-specific payload |

Harvest writes metrics to `.harvest/metrics.jsonl` as newline-delimited JSON. Each line is one metric snapshot. Historical data is never overwritten — harvest appends only, giving you a full time series.
